# HTML 5

HTML 5 refers to new features in HTML, not to a whole new variant

**<!DOCTYPE html>** can be entirely ignored as it doesn't do anything

**Inline Vs Block** 

- Inline elements will always go on the same line 
- Block Elements will always go on separate lines

**Span Vs Div**

- Div is a content divider. It is a generic container to group content together. DIVs are block level elements

- Spans are identical to div, but they are an inline container

**Random tags**

- A HR tag Inserts a horizontal line across the screen

- A BR tag Generates a line break

- A Superscript tag (sup) elevates content above the baseline. The tag is a sup <sup>tag</sup>

- A Subscript tag (sub) makes text appear below the baseline H2<sub>0</sub>

**Entity tags**

Entity codes allow you to insert preset icons/pics eg. copyright symbols, crosses, arrows. 

Tags can be found online ( https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref )

There are reserved Characters such as greater than/less than. These are best represented online using entity codes

These always start with an & and finish with a ; . &gt; is a greater than

&spades;<sub>This is an entity</sub>. Sub and sup can also do fractions :-) <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
