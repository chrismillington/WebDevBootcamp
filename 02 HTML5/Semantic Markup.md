# Semantic Markup

<hr>

**Definition** Semantic means things make sense and giving things meaning. This also means code should be understandable to humans

Examples of meaningful tags are

<ul>
<li>Header - for header <header></header>
<li>Footer - for footer <footer></footer>
<li>section - piece of content <section></section>
<li>article - Piece of writing <article></article>
<li>main - the main content  <main></main>
<li>nav - navigation<nav></nav>
</ul>

These make code far more meaningful than div's

You can have more specific tags like date, time and figure. 

Figure can be used to contain an image and can also attribute captions with the tag figcaption
