# Flex

Flex controls content layout. 

The container should have display set to flex
i.e.

    display:flex;

By default this will produce a row, but flex-direction:column can produce a column. Flex direction with a reverse on the end will send the flex the opposite way

To organise content, you need justify-content with: flex-start ( to left), flex-end ( to right ), flex-center ( centered)
space-around ( space around items) and space evenly ( space equally around each item)

To keep content on rows, flex-wrap:wrap/nowrap

Align items - Gives horizontal positioning ( start top, end bottom, center center)
